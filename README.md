This project is an automated data extraction, processing, and visualization system designed to streamline web data collection and analysis. The core of the project leverages Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with UiPath to scrape book-related data from an online bookstore. Since the website has infinite scrolling, UiPath automates scrolling and extracts book details, including name, author, price, type, and timestamp. The extracted data is initially stored in an Excel file, ensuring a structured format before further processing.  

To refine and transform the raw data, Alteryx is utilized. The book details scraped were initially merged in a single column, requiring data parsing and cleaning. Using Alteryxâ€™s Python scripting tool, the data was separated into distinct columns (Author, Price, and Type) while handling missing values by replacing them with NULL. After preprocessing, the clean dataset was stored in MySQL Workbench using an ODBC connection (Alteryx_MySQL_Connection). The database schema consists of structured tables ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage. SQL queries were used for data insertion, retrieval, and filtering, enabling organized and structured management of extracted data.  

To present the processed data in a visually appealing and interactive manner, a frontend web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend fetches data from a Node.js API (/api/books) and dynamically displays it in a tabular format using jQuery. To enhance data interpretation, Chart.js was integrated to generate bar, stacked bar, and pie charts for price and book type distribution. The application allows users to gain insights into pricing trends and book categories through these interactive visualizations.  

Overall, this project combines RPA, data transformation, database management, and web development to automate web scraping, clean and store data efficiently, and provide an engaging and insightful user interface for data exploration.
